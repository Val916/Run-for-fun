ü§ñ AI Tool Reflections
Throughout the development of this Django-based race platform, AI tools‚Äîprimarily GitHub Copilot‚Äîwere used to accelerate coding, streamline design decisions, and support testing. Here‚Äôs how they contributed across key phases:

User Story Definition & Planning: GitHub Copilot provided helpful suggestions for structuring user stories and acceptance criteria. While some outputs required refinement, it sped up the ideation process and aligned well with project goals.

Model & CRUD Development: Copilot assisted in generating Django model fields, views, and form logic. It offered boilerplate code for CRUD operations, which was manually adjusted to meet specific data constraints and user flows. Manual adjustments ensured accessibility and design consistency.

Front-End Design & Templates: AI tools helped scaffold Bootstrap components and layout structures. Copilot offered responsive design patterns and accessible markup, which were customized to match the chosen color palette and UX goals.

Testing & Debugging: Copilot supported the creation of Django test cases and helped identify edge cases. It also suggested fixes for template errors and static file issues during deployment.
