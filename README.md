##  Database Design

### ERD Diagram

<details> 

The Entity Relationship Diagram visually represents the structure of the database and the relationships between entities (tables).

<summary><b>Tables</b> </summary>

![Tables](docs\images\wireframes\2_diagram_tables.png)

<details>

  <summary><b>Click to view relationships between entities diagram</b> </summary>
  <img src="docs\images\wireframes\main_diagram.png" alt="Entities">

</details>


### Core Models

**CRUD Implementation**: Users can create their own races, update them (distance, difficulty, date, description, country and city), or delete them.

#### Race Model
```python
class Race(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()
    distance = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    difficulty = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=DIFFICULTY_CHOICES)
    race_date = models.DateTimeField()
    location_country = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    location_city = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    image = CloudinaryField('image', default='placeholder')
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    approved = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

#### Comment Model
```python
class Comment(models.Model):
    race = models.ForeignKey(Race, related_name='comments', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    body = models.TextField()
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    approved = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```
